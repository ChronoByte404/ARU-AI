# Jarvis
My personal AI, capable of local computer control and discord server auto-moderation.

Jarvis has two conversation modes - Random and Fixed - Random utilises the JanexBot library to generate responses and save inputs to reuse in conversations, but isn't 100% efficient as it starts with a relatively small database, where as Fixed is simply an intent classifier which ensures the appropriate responses are given in return.

Before usage, you need a discord bot key stored in discord_key.json, stored in the 'Settings' subdirectory. Once you create that, you're good to go.
